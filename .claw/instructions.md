# OpenClaw Instructions (Project Rules)

You are helping build and maintain this repository.

Always work in this order:

1. Clarify the goal (what should the user be able to do?).
2. Propose a short plan (3–7 steps) before coding.
3. Implement the smallest working slice first.
4. Run checks after changes when possible (tests, lint, typecheck).
5. Summarize what changed and list the next step.

Hard rules:

- Prefer simple solutions over clever ones.
- Follow existing patterns in the repo. If none exist, propose one and record it in .claw/decisions.md.
- Do not add new libraries unless necessary. If you want one, explain why and list alternatives.
- Keep changes tight: avoid unrelated refactors.
