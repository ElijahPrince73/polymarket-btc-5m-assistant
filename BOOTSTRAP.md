# Project Bootstrap (OpenClaw)

You are working inside this repository (Node.js + Express, mostly .js).

Before doing any work:

1. Read and follow these project rules:

- .claw/instructions.md
- .claw/coding-standards.md
- .claw/architecture.md
- .claw/decisions.md

2. Do NOT refactor or rewrite the project unless explicitly asked.
   Only change files needed for the current task.

3. Workflow:

- Propose a short plan (3–7 steps) before coding.
- After coding, summarize changes and list the next step.

If any of the .claw files are missing or unclear, ask a short question before making assumptions.
